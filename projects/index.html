  <div class="main">

  <h1>Class projects</h1>
  <p class="ucb-2013-week-intro-graf">In general, we are flexible about the format of your projects, so we don't want to have too many official requirements. Our only real goal is that you make something publishable. Below, some loose characteristics of a successful project. </p>

  <dl>
    <dt>The project is a work of original journalism.</dt>
    <dd>This is a requirement. It can be on a topic you're written about in the past, but it must contain original work and original findings. The purpose of your project should be journalistic, not technical. </dd>

   <dt>The project is based baded on findings that result from data analysis and processing.</dt>
   <dd>This might mean your conclusions came from data work done in Excel, like Vlookups, Pivot Tables, sorting and filtering. It might be based on a single data set or a handful of related data sets. But the lede of the project should be the answers to the questions you asked your data.</dd>


   <dt>The project should involve learning new skills that might not be covered in class.</dt>
   <dd>This class is about learning a little bit about being fluent with data, structured information and the internet, but your projects will all take you down new paths. As such, you're bound to run into some technical obstacles that class might not prepare you for. Maybe you found a structured data source but need to scrape the data to do it. Or maybe you want to make a more complicated map than we've made in class, or work with a data file with 1 million records, or make a project that's optimized for a mobile phone or tablet. A good project will demonstrate to us that you know how to learn new skills as you face new problems.</dd>

   <dt>The project must be published to the internet. (Duh.)</dt>
   <dd>Whether it's on your github page or a different site, your project must be publicly accessible. It should be a web page you coded and styled yourself (though you're encouraged to be inspired by other news pages you've seen before). You will write all the code yourself.</dd>

   <dt>Here are some examples of published NYT projects that could be (supercharged) class projects: </dt>
   <dd class="example"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/05/13/sports/baseball/money-on-the-bench.html">Money on the Bench</a> Forget the silly timer, the bar charts and the icons. A table that updates every day based that answers a (semi-) journalistically relevant would be totally doable.
   </dd>
   <dd class="example"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/03/29/sports/baseball/Strikeouts-Are-Still-Soaring.html">Strikeouts on the Rise</a> Your project could be a mix of analytical copy and charts. Excel charts would do just fine here.
   </dd>

   <dd class="example"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/us/politics/white-house-doors-open-for-big-donors.html?pagewanted=all#p7#h7">White House Opens Door to Big Donors, and Lobbyists Slip In</a> It would be great if your project ran on the front page of the Sunday NYT, at its heart this story is really just an Excel filter. Or you might make a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/04/15/us/politics/Access-in-Washington-Rises-With-Donation-Size.html?ref=politics">small chart</a> in Excel to accompany your main points.
   </dd>

   <dd class="example"><a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/03/with-lautenbergs-death-senate-lacks-a-world-war-ii-veteran/">Lautenberg's Death Continues Sharp Decrease in Military Veterans in Senate</a> One of the most analytical popular blogs on the Internet has no fancy charts; instead, fact-based ledes and the data to back them up, sometimes accompanied by an Excel chart.
   </dd>

   <dd class="example"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/01/29/us/where-50000-guns-in-chicago-came-from.html">Where 50,000 Guns Recovered in Chicago Came From</a>This could easily be a Google map or a stately map instead of a Javascript one.
   </dd>

   <dd class="example"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/05/07/education/college-admissions-gap.html">College Admissions Gap</a>Take away the interactive chart and the 4-step walkthrough and this is just 4 answers to 4 Excel questions.
   </dd>

   <dd class="example"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/05/04/nyregion/seeking-flexibility-during-storms.html?ref=nyregion">Seeking Flexibility During Storms</a>This could be a story where your map leads you to interview people who live in the new evacuation zones.
   </dd>

   <dd class="example"><a href="http://www.edexcellence.net/commentary/education-gadfly-daily/flypaper/2012/the-fastest-gentrifying-neighborhoods-in-the-united-states.html">The fastest-<del>gentrifying</del> neighborhoods in the United States</a>Here's another example where very simple data work might lead you somewhere interesting.
   </dd>

   <dd class="example"><a href="http://www.mattglassman.com/?p=2482">Capitol South, Station Domination, and Lobbying Effectiveness</a>Some of <a href="http://www.twitter.com/amandacox">The Godfather</a>'s favorite data work is not hugely complicated.
   </dd>
