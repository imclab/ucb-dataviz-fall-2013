    <h2>The spectrum</h2>
    <p><span class="quote">“It always amazes me how little code you need to capture the essence of data graphics, and how much code you need for all the fiddly details like scales and axes and legends.”</span> - <a href="http://had.co.nz/">Hadley Wickham</a>, creator of <a href="http://ggplot2.org/">ggplot2</a> and many other R packages</p>

What questions do you want your visualization to answer? Why is it important? Here's one graphic that shows <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/10/05/business/economy/one-report-diverging-perspectives.html">different perspectives</a> on the same data set.</p>

    <p>This <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/">amazing data blog</a> has static, semi ugly charts, and it still communicates its ideas well.</p>
