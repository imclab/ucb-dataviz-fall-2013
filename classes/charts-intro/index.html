    <h1>The complicated spectrum of data graphics and getting started with charts!</h1>
    <p>We'll examine an inherent conflict of data visualzations (especially where this class is concerned) and then get our hands dirty with some basic charts in R and D3.</p>
    <h2>Housekeeping</h2>
    <p>Going over some things that we might have missed in the first class. Office hours, class expectations, things we don't like, etc.</p>
    <h2>Critique</h2>
    <p>Shan and Kevin (Shevin) will give an example of the kind of critique we'll be expecting you to do in subsequent classes. Details are on the class home page. They'll be discussing <a href="">this recent series of charts</a> TKTK.</p>

    <h2>Lecture</h2>
    <p><a href="lecture.html">The essence vs. the fiddly bits of data graphics, and understanding chart types.</a>.</p>

    <h2>Lab</h2>


    <p>We'll make some bar charts with R and D3, but mostly we'll get familiar with the console and environments of each. We'll be replicating Kevin's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/sports/ncaafootball/to-defend-its-empire-espn-stays-on-offensive.html#g-histogram">favorite bar chart</a> of 2013.</p>

    <h4> Getting started with the R console</h4>
    <p>R isn't hard, but it can feel difficult because it's picky. The difference between a map or chart that works and one that's broken can sometimes just be a missing argument to a method (like <code>stringsAsFactors=F</code> or <code>horiz=T</code>), which can be frustrating. Rather than try to cover all of thes eexhaustively, we'll just start making some projects and learn as we go.</p>

    <ol class="steps">
      <li>You should have R or RStudio installed on your machine or desktop. If you don't, <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">install it</a> and run it form the applications menu. You should see the R console, which looks like this:
      <img src="intro.jpg">
      (If you have the R IDE instead of this basic R console, that's fine too. Each has its merits.)
      </li>
      <li>Make a folder on your desktop called <code>week2</code> or something else of your choosing. In that folder, make a new file called <code>tutorials.R</code> in a text editor and save it to your project folder. Start by typing your working directory in your R text file and pasting it into the R console.
        <pre>
          <code class="language-r">setwd("~/Desktop/week2") #or wherever you're keeping your code</code>
        </pre>
      </li>

      <li>
        Start typing things into the console and discuss what happens after each.
      <pre>
        <code class="language-r">"I should exercise more."

1+1

1==2

1:1000

animals <- c("bears","monkeys","donkeys")

animals[1]

class(animals)

class(1==2)

class(1:1000)

</code>
</pre>
</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Making a bar chart in R</h4>
    <ol class="steps">
      <li>The thing we need for any chart is data. Download <a href="subscription-prices.csv">this CSV</a> of the cost of various cable channels per subscriber per month. Save it to your local project folder. (PS, do you know what a CSV is?) </li>
      <li>Load the file under the variable name <code>prices</code>
      <pre>
        <code class="language-r">prices <- read.csv("subscription-prices.csv")</code>
      </pre>
      </li>

      <li>Let's try a few things, one at a time, and discuss:
      <pre>
<code class="language-r">class(prices)
dim(prices)
head(prices)
head(prices, n=20)
names(prices)
prices$X2013
prices$X2013[1:10]
class(prices$X2013)
?head
prices[1,]
prices[,1]
prices[,c("Network")]
prices[1:10,c("Network")]</code>

      </pre>
      </li>

      <li>
        Before we make any charts, let's get to know our data. How many rows does it have? How many columns? What are other meaningful questions we could ask (or should probably know the answer to)?
      </li>

      <li>
        Let's see what a basic plot of the prices looks like.
        <pre>
          <code>plot(prices$X2013)</code>
        </pre>
        <img src="first-plot.png">
        We only gave it one vector to plot, but it's plotting on both X and Y coordinates. What does the X axis represent here?
      </li>

      <li>
        That chart isn't so fun. What order is our data in? Let's sort our data frame in order from highest price to lowest. (This isn't the most fun to write, but we resort a lot in R, so you this code will come in handy later.)
        <pre>
          <code class="language-r">prices <- prices[order(prices$X2013, decreasing=T),]</code>
        </pre>
      </li>



      <li>
        Now let's do the same plot as before.
        <pre>
          <code>plot(prices$X2013)</code>
        </pre>
        <img src="basic-plot.png">
      </li>

      <li>Try a different kind of plot (one R is kind of annoying about, actually).
      <pre>
        <code>barplot(prices$X2013)</code>
      </pre>
      <img src="first-barplot.png">
        Note the difference here in the X axis. Which plot do you prefer?
      </li>

      <li>Note that you can give all sorts of arguments to the plot commands. Take a look through the docs with <code>?plot</code>. Here's the same plot as before, but with some extra arguments.
      <pre>
        <code>barplot(prices$X2013, col="lightgrey", border=F, main="Total control!", ylab="Price")</code>
      </pre>
      <img src="second-barplot.png">
      </li>

      <li>Let's do a little logic and sorting, then replot.
      <pre>
        <code class="language-r">#sorting
prices <- prices[order(prices$X2013),]
barcolors <- ifelse(prices$Network == "ESPN", "red", "lightgrey")
barplot(prices$X2013, col=barcolors, border=F, main="Now with custom colors!", ylab="Price")</code>
      </pre>
      <img src="third-barplot.png">
      That's it! You made your first data visualization in R. It's not the best, but it's only about three lines of code. In a hurry, you could post this online very quickly – Nate Silver probably would too. But it's static and inflexible – what if you wanted users to be able to look up any station, or resize the chart based on which device a user was coming from? For increased flexibility, you might want to draw this chart in a web browser.
      </li>

    </ol>

    <h4>Getting started with the Javascript console</h4>

    <ol class="steps">
      <li>Close your R files for now and create a blank HTML page like the one described by Scott Murray in his <a href="http://alignedleft.com/tutorials/d3/setup">great D3 tutorial</a>. You can download that file <a href="0-d3.html">right here</a>, but make sure you save it to your local directory. Name the file <code>index.html</code>.</li>
     <li>
        Open your <code>index.html</code> page (which might be blank, which is fine) and open the Console. (View > Developer > Javascript Console.) Type <code>d3</code> in the console and see what you get. You should get a response that says you loaded D3 successfully.
        <img src="console-screenshot.png">
      </li>


        <li> Let's try typing the same things we did with R earlier, and note the small differences.

         <pre>
        <code>"I should exercise more."

1+1

1==2

1:1000 // doesn't work

animals = ["bears","monkeys","donkeys"] // new array syntax

animals[1] //note zero-based

typeof animals //not "class"

typeof (1 === 2)

</code>
</pre>

      The Javascript Console is going to be one of our best ways to inspect and debug the HTML, CSS and Javascript we write. The sooner you get comfortable with it, the better.
      </li>

    <!-- <h4>Making a bar chart in D3</h4> -->

      <li>Before we start coding, let's get set up in the Terminal by starting a server on port 8000 using Python's <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html">SimpleHTTPServer</a>. To do this, use your terminal to navigate to the folder that contains your empty html page. Then type:
        <pre>
          <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer</code>
        </pre>

      Now we're ready to start coding. Your <code>index.html</code> file is now accessible by going to <code>localhost:8000</code> on your web browser.
      </li>

      <li>
        Inside your script tag, let's write some Javascript using D3. First, let's add a headline:

        <pre>
          <code class="language-javascript">d3.select("body").append("h1").text("My first bar chart")</code>
        </pre>
        What just happened?
      </li>

      <li>Now let's add an SVG element to the page with the <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3019563">margin conventions</a> described by Mike Bostock, the creator of D3. Basically, this code tells your browser to draw a big box (an SVG element) on the page. We're going to draw a chart inside this box. The <code>margin</code> stuff seems confusing at first, but these are the fiddly bits Hadley is describing.

        <pre>
          <code class="language-javascript">var margin = {top: 20, right: 10, bottom: 20, left: 10};

var width = 600 - margin.left - margin.right,
height = 250 - margin.top - margin.bottom;

var svg = d3.select("body").append("svg")
    .attr("width", width + margin.left + margin.right)
    .attr("height", height + margin.top + margin.bottom)
    .append("g")
    .attr("transform", "translate(" + margin.left + "," + margin.top + ")");
          </code>

        </pre>
        Use the Chrome inspector to see if your code worked. If it did, you should have an SVG element on your page.
      </li>

      <li>

        Let's add a plain rectangle to the SVG element just to get used to the syntax.

        <pre>
          <code class="language-javascript">var testRectangle = svg.append("rect")
    .attr("x", 20)
    .attr("y", 100)
    .attr("height", 50)
    .attr("width", 200)
    .attr("class", "testbar");
          </code>
        </pre>

        Make a CSS block on the top of your <code>index.html</code> page to style your rectangle.

        <pre>
          <code class="language-html">&lt;style type="text.css"&gt;
.svg {
  stroke: 2px solid orange;
}

.testbar {
  fill: #ff00ff;
}
&lt;/style&gt

          </code>
        </pre>

        It might look like this:
        <img src="test-svg.png">

        What do the x and y positions we set mean?

        </li>

    <li>
      Obviously, this is just a random rectangle and we need it to be a bar chart that represents our data.
    </li>
