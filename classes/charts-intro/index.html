    <h1>The complicated spectrum of data graphics and getting started with charts!</h1>
    <p>We'll examine an inherent conflict of data visualzations (especially where this class is concerned) and then get our hands dirty with some basic charts in R and D3.</p>
    <h2>Housekeeping</h2>
    <p>Going over some things that we might have missed in the first class. Office hours, class expectations, things we don't like, etc.</p>
    <h2>Critique</h2>
    <p>Shan and Kevin (Shevin) will give an example of the kind of critique we'll be expecting you to do in subsequent classes. Details are on the class home page. They'll be discussing <a href="">this recent series of charts</a> TKTK.</p>

    <h2>Lecture</h2>
    <p><a href="lecture.html">The essence vs. the fiddly bits of data graphics, and understanding chart types.</a>.</p>

    <h2>Lab</h2>
    <p>We'll make some bar charts with R and D3, but mostly we'll get familiar with the console and environments of each. We'll be replicating Kevin's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/sports/ncaafootball/to-defend-its-empire-espn-stays-on-offensive.html#g-histogram">favorite bar chart</a> of 2013.</p>

    <h4> Getting started with the R console</h4>
    <p>You should have R installed on your machine or desktop. If you don't, <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">install it</a> and run it form the applications menu. You should see the R console, which looks like this:</p>

<p>Before we start breaking things, let's get our workspace set up properly. Make a folder on your desktop called <code>cuny-tutorial</code>. In that folder, make a new file called <code>tutorials.R</code> in a text editor and save it to your project folder. Start by typing your working directory in your R text file and pasting it into the R console. (Cutting and pasting from static files is not the classiest way to do things, since there's an <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/ide/">R IDE</a> now, but this is how <a href="https://twitter.com/amandacox">the Godfather</a> does it, so it's good enough for us.)</p>


<pre>
  <code>
    setwd("~/Desktop/cuny-tutorial")
  </code>
</pre>

<p>Start typing things into the console and discuss what happens after each.</p>

<pre>
  <code>
    "I should exercise more."

    1+1

    1==2

    1:1000

    animals <- c("bears","monkeys","donkeys")

    animals[1]

    class(animals)

    class(1==2)

    class(1:1000)

  </code>
</pre>

<h5 class="example-class-questions">Questions/thoughts?</h5>

<p>R isn't hard, but it can feel difficult because it's picky. The difference between a map or chart that works and one that's broken can sometimes just be a missing argument to a method (like <code>stringsAsFactors=F</code> or <code>horiz=T</code>), which can be frustrating. Rather than try to cover all of thes eexhaustively, we'll just start making some projects and learn as we go. </p>
