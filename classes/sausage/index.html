    <h1>Why we’re here, the big deal about data journalism and making the sausage of the internet</h1>
    <p>After doing basic first-day-type activities and introductions, we'll go over a short history of data journalism, show some prominent examples of great data visualizations, and then get right into coding up a page from scratch.</p>

    <h2>Lab</h2>
    <p>Before we do anything super useful or innovative with our soon-to-be-shiny data skills, we need to be able to have a place to write our files so they are public on the internet and all the apps and settings that go along with that. This exercise will make sure everyone is properly set up to publish our projects on Github.</p>

    <h3>Signing up for Github</h3>
    <p>We’ll be creating all our projects through <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>. If you’ve never used <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> or Github before, don’t worry, it’s not as scary as it may seem at first. It’s basically like <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> for programmers.</p>
    <ol class="steps">
      <li>
        <p>First, go to <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> and create a username and password, etc.</p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/"><img src="github-welcome.png"></a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Once you are logged in, click on “Create a repository.” You should see this screen:</p>
        <p><img src="create-repo.png"></p>
        <p>Name your repo “dataviz-home”.</p>
        <p>Make sure you check “Initialize this repository with a README”.</p>
        <p>Finally, click the button that says “Create repository.”</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You’ve just intialized a Git repository! Nice. Now we need to copy it to our computers.</p>
        <p><img src="create-repo-success.png"></p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Creating a Home For Our Repositories</h3>
    <p>Some of this might seem kind of fussy, but since we’ll be doing a lot of debugging on everyone’s machines, I want to make sure we’re all working the same way. So, first let’s create a home folder for all our class repositories.</p>

    <ol class="steps">
      <li>
        <p>Go to your home directory, it’s the one in your sidebar with a house icon. (Mine is called “shan”. Keyboard shortcut to go there: <code>⌘⇧H</code>)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Inside this folder, create a new folder called “dataviz-fall-2013”. This is where we’re going to store all of our repositories.</p>
        <p><img src="starting-folder.png"></p>
      </li>
    </ol>


    <h3>Installing Github on Your Computer</h3>
    <p>Now you’ll need the Github application on your computer so you can edit and sync your projects.</p>
    <ol class="steps">
      <li>
        <p>Download and install the Github application. <a href="http://mac.github.com/">Mac</a> or <a href="http://windows.github.com/">Windows</a>.</p>
        <p><a href="http:mac.github.com"><img src="github-download.png"></a></p>
      <p>(If you get stuck in the future, there are good help pages for <a href="http://mac.github.com/help.html">Mac</a> and <a href="http://windows.github.com/help.html">Windows</a>.)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>After installing, when you first launch the application it will ask you to move it to the Applications folder. Say “yes”.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>When it re-launches, it’ll step you through a setup process. You’ll need to enter your shiny new Github credentials, you’ll want the command-line tools, but you don’t need to “add local repositories”.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You should now see a window that lists one repository: “dataviz-home”. Click the button next to it that says “Clone to Computer”.</p>
        <p><img src="list-of-repos.png"></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A dialog window will popup. Navigate to your “dataviz-fall-2013” folder in your home directory. Click “Clone”.</p>
        <p><img src="save-to-home.png"></p></li>
      <li>
        <p>Click on the little arrow next to your repo name and you now can see the whole edit history for that repo. You should only have one entry, and it’ll be called “Initial Commit”.</p>
        <p><img src="first-commit.png"></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Now, go back to the Finder and find your home directory. There should be a folder within “dataviz-fall-2013” called “dataviz-home”, with one file inside of it.</p>
        <p><img src="dataviz-home.png"></p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Great, you should be all setup to make your first edit in your new repo, but first we need to take a short detour for a good text editor.</p></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Installing Sublime Text</h3>
    <p>If you already have a text editor you like, feel free to skip this section. If not, then it’s probably best you install <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>.</p>
    <ol class="steps">
      <li>
        <p>Download and install <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>.</p>
        <p><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/"><img src="sublime-text.png"></a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>To make the most of Sublime, we’re also going to install a package manager for it (packages are like extensions that add features). Follow the “Manual” directions for the <a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/installation#Manual">Sublime Package Manager</a>.</p>
        <p><a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/installation#Manual"><img src="sublime-package-manager.png"></a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Once installed, here are some <a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/docs/usage">instructions</a> for how to install and remove packages.</p>
        <p>The basic pattern is: You open a window in sublime, hit ⌘⇧P, then type “install” and choose “Package Control: Install Package”.</p>
        <p><img src="sublime-install-package.png"></p>
        <p>Next, type in the name of the package and hit return — “Soda” in this instance.</p>
        <p><img src="sublime-soda.png"></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>I recommend not installing too many packages, as it’s best not to gunk up sublime with too many of these, but you can browse them all <a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/">here</a> if you’re curious. Go ahead and install these three: <a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Theme%20-%20Soda">Theme - Soda</a>, <a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/SideBarEnhancements">SideBarEnhancements</a> and <a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/ColorPicker">ColorPicker</a>; </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Finally, Making Something</h3>
    <p>Let’s try to put it all together and actually add something to our repo.</p>
    <ol class="steps">
      <li>
        <p>Open up our project folder “dataviz-home” in Sublime Text. You can do this one of two ways: 1. Go to File > Open and choose the “dataviz-home” folder. 2. Drag the “dataviz-home” folder onto the Sublime Text application icon in the dock. Either way you should end up with this:</p>
        <p><img src="dataviz-home-sublime.png"></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Now, create a new file. The easiest way is to right-click on the folder named “dataviz-home” in the sidebar.</p>
        <p><img src="new-file.png"></p>
        <p>A small text field will open at the bottom of screen. Type in “index.html” and hit return.</p>
        <p><img src="new-file-name.png"></p>
        <p>This is what you should end up with in the end:</p>
        <p><img src="new-file-success.png"></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Enter in some HTML. To get started, here is the bare minimum:</p>
        <p><img src="html.png"></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Now we need to save those changes back up to Github servers. First, go to the Github app and click on the changes tab. You should see all your changes listed there.</p>
        <p><img src="github-changes.png"></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In Git, you bundle changes together into a “commit” which requires a short description. I’ve typed in “Added index page”. We also want to click the button with a plus and rotating arrows to mark that we want to automatically sync with Github servers each time we make a commit.</p>
        <p><img src="github-commit-sync.png"></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Now, finally, make your commit — push the button that says “Commit & Sync”. Now click over to the "History" tab and you should see two commits listed. You can click back and forth on the commits to see what changes were made.</p>
        <p><img src="github-successful-commit.png"></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you want to go deep, here’s a <a href="http://git-scm.com/book">very detailed overview of git</a>.</p></li>
