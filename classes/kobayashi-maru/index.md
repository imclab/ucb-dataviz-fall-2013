##News exercise

<img src="kobayashi-maru.jpg">

We've done a few do-as-we-do exercises; today we'll break into groups and let you come up with your own visualizations.

**Here's the scenario:** You're an intern at the data desk of the Los Angeles Times. You've you've noticed that every month when unemployment numbers come out, they only publish the top-level rates, with no other details. You're hoping to make an impact as an intern so you can get hired (obviously!), but you're also interested in helping readers understand unemployment rates in the state in a more nuanced way.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics has loads of data about employment, but the one you're planning on using is [Smoothed Seasonally Adjusted Metropolitan Area Estimates](http://www.bls.gov/lau/metrossa.htm) for Calfornia. Today in class, you'll explore this data, ask and answer questions, make a visualization and publish it to the internet.

**Group 1:** Erik Reyna, Chelsi Moy, Stephen Fisher

**Group 2:** Diego Barido, Aaron Mendelson, Samantha Masunaga

**Group 3:** Mihir Zaveri, Julie Brown, Angela Lyn Hart

**Group 4:** Jessica Hamel, Sean Greene, Tawanda Kanhema

**Group 5:** Pearly Tan, Sam Rolens, Nausheen Husain
