##News exercise

We've done a few do-as-we-do exercises; today we'll break into groups and let you come up with your own visualizations.

**Here's the scenario:** You're an intern at the data desk of the Los Angeles Times. You've you've noticed that every month when unemployment numbers come out, they only publish the top-level rates, with no other details. You're hoping to make an impact as an intern so you can get hired (obviously!), but you're also interested in helping readers understand unemployment rates in the state in a more nuanced way.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics has loads of data about employment, but the one you're planning on using is Smoothed Seasonally Adjusted Metropolitan Area Estimates for Calfornia. Today in class, you'll explore this data, ask and answer questions, make a visualization and publish it to the internet.

- **4:30pm** Download and format the [data](http://www.bls.gov/lau/metrossa.htm). Load it into Excel, R or D3.

- As a group, come up with 6 questions that you want to answer

- **4:50pm** Call Shavin over to approve your questions. Don’t continue without approval.

- Try to answer your questions.

- Sketch on paper what you want to build with your new knowledge

- **5:30pm** Call Shavin to approve your sketch

- Decide who's doing what. Here’s one idea for roles but feel free to do whatever you want:
    - Research and writing text analysis
    - R sketching and answering data questions
    - Web development of the final project

- Start building your sketch.

- **6:30pm** and publish a URL to a github repo.

- **6:45pm** We’re all going to share our projects.
