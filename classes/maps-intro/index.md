##Housekeeping

• Are you a member of the [class Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ucb-datavis-2013)? Are you sure? **Are you really sure?**

• Check out the [gallery of line charts](bar-chart-gallery.html) from your assignments. You should all have gotten feedback on both assignments by now.

• Common mistakes:

  - Tk


• Office hours at 6:30 this weekend

• Two new wikis: first, a [wiki](https://github.com/shancarter/ucb-dataviz-fall-2013/wiki/Things-We-Don't-Get) where you can ask any questions you might have about D3, data, or anything. (Like "what is a data join" or "how do I make a table in D3" or "can I subset by multiple values in R?"). And another one for the [schedule for critiques](https://github.com/shancarter/ucb-dataviz-fall-2013/wiki/Class-presentation-schedule).

• Let's talk about [projects](../../projects/index.html)

##Critique
Julie and Jess will be discussing [these charts of unisex names](http://flowingdata.com/2013/09/25/the-most-unisex-names-in-us-history/). For fun, let's also discuss [a similar set of charts](http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2009/05/17/weekinreview/20090517_NAME_GRFK.html) from the NYT.
