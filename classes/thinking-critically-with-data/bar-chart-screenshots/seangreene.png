sd,

just a follow up to our talk yesterday...

first, I appreciate my recent bonus and your flexibility in letting me work from SF with Shan this fall. as you said, I'm learning a lot, working with people I like and admire, contributing editorial ideas in an open environment and making plenty of money. my life does not suck. I know this.

at the same time, when I am frustrated with the job I am reminded of the deep structual issues we're not facing. print remains the primary editorial focus of the newsroom, and even when we're making things first for the web we're making them again in print. most of our daily work is coordinated by people whose primary job is filling space in the print edition. great online applications do not come out of porting these thigns to the web. and, despite archie's insistence that everyone will get on board this year, it's not going to happen. if anything, NYT5 will make it harder for most members of our staff to make things for the web.
